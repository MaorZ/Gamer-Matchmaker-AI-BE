import { MongoClient } from "mongodb";

const client = new MongoClient(process.env.MONGODB_URI || "mongodb://localhost:27017");
const collection = client.db("games_db").collection("games");

const vectorStore = new MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch(embeddings, {
  collection: collection,
  indexName: "vector_index",
  textKey: "text_data",
  embeddingKey: "embedding",
});
Deployment Architecture
Let's visualize how these systems can be deployed locally and in the cloud:





















The diagram above illustrates both local and cloud architectures, where:

Green components represent local development environment
Blue components show cloud infrastructure
Purple boxes indicate database services
Pink boxes represent embedding services
Both architectures share the same core components but scale differently. The dotted arrow indicates the migration path, showing how your application can seamlessly transition from local to cloud deployment without changing the underlying architecture.

Based on your specific requirements:

Primary Recommendation: MongoDB Atlas Vector Search
More straightforward setup for Node.js developers
Excellent LangChain.js integration js.langchain.com
Seamless transition from local to cloud
Flexible schema design for game metadata
Alternative Option: Qdrant
Native vector database optimized for embeddings
Strong performance characteristics
Simple LangChain.js integration js.langchain.com
More control over vector operations
Both options will handle your 200k records efficiently, but MongoDB Atlas might offer a gentler learning curve due to its familiar JSON-based data model and extensive documentation for Node.js applications.

Remember
Start with local testing using either option's development setup, then migrate to cloud services when needed. Both solutions support this transition path without requiring significant architectural changes.

Let's say I want to use OpenAI to create the embeddings, can I save then in natural DB so I can migrate those embedding in the future to either of those 2 or a 3rd one If I want so? (I want to do the embeddings operations once for all the vector DBs in the future)
PHIND-70B MODEL
Yes, you can definitely save OpenAI embeddings in a neutral format for future flexibility. Let me show you how this works architecturally:




















The diagram above illustrates the architecture where:

Pink represents your source game objects
Blue shows the neutral storage layer options
Green indicates potential future vector stores
Each arrow represents a transformation or movement of data, with OpenAI embeddings serving as the bridge between your source data and future vector stores.

Now, let's look at how to implement this architecture with concrete code examples:

JSON File Storage Approach
Suggested
OPTION 1

interface GameEmbedding {
  gameId: string;
  metadata: {
    genres: string[];
    platforms: string[];
  };
  textFields: {
    name: string;
    description: string;
    storyline: string;
  };
  embedding: number[]; // OpenAI embedding vector
}

// Save embeddings
const saveEmbeddingToFile = async (gameId: string, embedding: number[]) => {
  const filePath = `./embeddings/${gameId}.json`;
  await fs.writeFile(
    filePath,
    JSON.stringify({
      gameId,
      metadata: await getGameMetadata(gameId),
      textFields: await getGameTextFields(gameId),
      embedding
    } as GameEmbedding)
  );
};

// Load embeddings for migration
const loadEmbeddingsFromFile = async () => {
  const files = await fs.readdir('./embeddings');
  return Promise.all(files.map(async file => {
    const content = await fs.readFile(`./embeddings/${file}`, 'utf8');
    return JSON.parse(content);
  }));
};
Pros
Simple to implement and debug
Human-readable format
Easy version control integration
No database dependencies
Cons
Less performant for large datasets
Manual file management required
Limited querying capabilities
This approach stores each embedding as a separate JSON file, making it extremely portable and easy to inspect. The interface ensures consistent structure while allowing future extensions. The file-based approach makes it particularly suitable for development and testing phases.

SQLite Database Storage Approach
OPTION 2

interface GameEmbedding {
  id: string;
  metadata: Buffer; // Stored as JSON string
  text_fields: Buffer; // Stored as JSON string
  embedding: Buffer; // Stored as binary array
}

// Initialize SQLite connection
const db = new sqlite3.Database('embeddings.db');

// Save embeddings
const saveEmbedding = async (gameId: string, embedding: number[]) => {
  const stmt = await db.prepare(`
    INSERT INTO embeddings VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)
  `);
  
  await stmt.run([
    gameId,
    JSON.stringify(await getGameMetadata(gameId)),
    JSON.stringify(await getGameTextFields(gameId)),
    Buffer.from(embedding)
  ]);
};

// Load embeddings for migration
const loadEmbeddings = async () => {
  const rows = await db.all('SELECT * FROM embeddings');
  return rows.map(row => ({
    id: row.id,
    metadata: JSON.parse(row.metadata.toString()),
    text_fields: JSON.parse(row.text_fields.toString()),
    embedding: Array.from(row.embedding)
  }));
};
Pros
Better performance for large datasets
Structured querying capabilities
Atomic operations support
Single file management
Cons
More complex setup
Requires SQLite dependency
Less human-readable format
This approach uses SQLite to store embeddings in a structured database format. While slightly more complex than JSON files, it offers better performance and querying capabilities. The binary storage of vectors ensures efficient space usage while maintaining data integrity.

Migration Process
Once you've stored your embeddings, migrating to either vector store is straightforward:


// Example migration to MongoDB Atlas
const migrateToMongoDB = async () => {
  const embeddings = await loadEmbeddingsFromFile(); // Or loadEmbeddings()
  
  const vectorStore = new MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch(embeddings, {
    collection: collection,
    indexName: "vector_index",
    textKey: "text_data",
    embeddingKey: "embedding"
  });
  
  await vectorStore.addDocuments(embeddings);
};
Best Practices
Version Control
Store embedding versions alongside metadata
Document any preprocessing steps
Keep track of OpenAI model versions used
Data Integrity
Implement checksum validation
Maintain backup copies
Validate embedding dimensions consistently
Future Proofing
Use consistent naming conventions
Document transformation steps
Include metadata about creation process
By implementing either storage approach, you'll maintain flexibility to migrate to any vector store in the future while ensuring your embeddings remain usable regardless of the destination system.

I chose to use qdrant, can you show me the Migration Process for it?
PHIND-70B MODEL
Here's a comprehensive guide to migrating your game objects to Qdrant:

Migration Architecture
Let's first understand how the migration process flows:






The diagram illustrates the complete migration flow where:

The Client represents your Node.js application coordinating the migration
OpenAI Embeddings service generates vector representations of your game objects
Qdrant Client handles communication with the database
Qdrant DB stores the final game objects with their embeddings
Each game object goes through embedding generation and storage in batches, ensuring efficient migration of your dataset.

Implementation Steps

Initialize Qdrant Client

import { QdrantClient } from "@qdrant/qdrant-js";

const client = new QdrantClient({
  host: process.env.QDRANT_HOST || "localhost",
  port: parseInt(process.env.QDRANT_PORT || "6333"),
});

const collectionName = "games-collection";

Set Up Collection Structure

await client.collections.create({
  name: collectionName,
  vectors_config: {
    size: 1536, // OpenAI embedding dimension
    distance: "Cosine"
  },
  payload_schema: {
    games_metadata: {
      genres: "text",
      platforms: "text",
      release_date: "int64",
      rating: "float"
    },
    text_fields: {
      name: "text",
      description: "text",
      storyline: "text"
    }
  }
});

Create Migration Function

async function migrateGameObjects(gameObjects: GameObject[]) {
  const batchSize = 100;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < gameObjects.length; i += batchSize) {
    const batch = gameObjects.slice(i, i + batchSize);
    
    const points = await Promise.all(batch.map(async (game) => ({
      id: game.id,
      vector: await generateOpenAIEmbedding(game),
      payload: {
        games_metadata: {
          genres: game.genres.join(","),
          platforms: game.platforms.join(","),
          release_date: game.releaseDate,
          rating: game.rating || null
        },
        text_fields: {
          name: game.name,
          description: game.description,
          storyline: game.storyline
        }
      }
    })));
    
    await client.points.upsert({
      collection_name: collectionName,
      points: points
    });
    
    console.log(`Migrated batch ${Math.floor(i/batchSize) + 1}/${Math.ceil(gameObjects.length/batchSize)}`);
  }
}

async function generateOpenAIEmbedding(game: GameObject) {
  const embeddingService = new OpenAIEmbeddings({
    model: "text-embedding-3-large",
    api_key: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
  });
  
  const combinedText = `${game.name}. ${game.description}. ${game.storyline}`;
  const embeddings = await embeddingService.embed(combinedText);
  return embeddings[0];
}

Verify Migration

async function verifyMigration() {
  const totalPoints = await client.points.count({
    collection_name: collectionName
  });
  
  console.log(`Total points migrated: ${totalPoints}`);
  
  // Sample verification
  const sampleQuery = {
    limit: 5,
    filter: {
      must: [
            { match: { payload_games_metadata_genres: "Action" }}
          ]
    },
    with_payload: true
  };
  
  const sampleResults = await client.points.search({
    collection_name: collectionName,
    query_vector: null,
    ...sampleQuery
  });
  
  console.log("Sample verification results:", 
    sampleResults.points.map(p => ({
      id: p.id,
      genres: p.payload.games_metadata.genres.split(","),
      name: p.payload.text_fields.name
    })));
}
Best Practices
Error Handling

try {
  await migrateGameObjects(gameObjects);
  await verifyMigration();
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Migration failed:", error);
  // Implement retry logic or partial migration handling
}
Performance Optimization
Adjust batch sizes based on memory constraints
Consider parallel processing for embeddings generation
Monitor Qdrant's CPU and RAM usage during migration
Data Validation
Verify embedding dimensions match collection settings
Validate metadata formats before migration
Check data consistency after migration
Remember
Test the migration process with a small subset of data first to validate the flow and optimize performance characteristics for your specific dataset.

I ment the migration from the sqlLite local storge
PHIND-70B MODEL
Here's how to migrate your game objects from SQLite to Qdrant:

Migration Architecture
Let's first understand how the migration process flows:






The diagram illustrates the complete migration flow where:

SQLite DB contains your existing game objects with embeddings
Migration Client coordinates the transfer process
Qdrant DB is the target system for your game objects
Each batch of game objects goes through a transformation process before being stored in Qdrant, ensuring data integrity during migration.

Implementation Steps

Set Up SQLite Connection

import sqlite3 from 'sqlite3';
import { QdrantClient } from "@qdrant/qdrant-js";

// SQLite connection
const db = new sqlite3.Database('embeddings.db');

// Qdrant client
const qdrantClient = new QdrantClient({
  host: process.env.QDRANT_HOST || "localhost",
  port: parseInt(process.env.QDRANT_PORT || "6333"),
});

Create Migration Function

async function migrateFromSQLite() {
  const batchSize = 100;
  let totalMigrated = 0;
  
  // Create collection if it doesn't exist
  try {
    await qdrantClient.collections.create({
      name: "games-collection",
      vectors_config: {
        size: 1536, // OpenAI embedding dimension
        distance: "Cosine"
      },
      payload_schema: {
        games_metadata: {
          genres: "text",
          platforms: "text",
          release_date: "int64",
          rating: "float"
        },
        text_fields: {
          name: "text",
          description: "text",
          storyline: "text"
        }
      }
    });
  } catch (e) {
    if (!e.message.includes("Collection already exists")) {
      throw e;
    }
  }

  // Read and migrate in batches
  const query = `
    SELECT id, metadata, text_fields, embedding 
    FROM embeddings 
    ORDER BY id 
    LIMIT ? OFFSET ?
  `;

  let offset = 0;
  let hasMore = true;

  while (hasMore) {
    const stmt = await db.prepare(query);
    const rows = await stmt.all({
      $limit: batchSize,
      $offset: offset
    });
    
    if (rows.length === 0) {
      hasMore = false;
      break;
    }

    const points = rows.map(row => ({
      id: row.id,
      vector: Array.from(Buffer.from(row.embedding)),
      payload: {
        games_metadata: JSON.parse(row.metadata.toString()),
        text_fields: JSON.parse(row.text_fields.toString())
      }
    }));

    await qdrantClient.points.upsert({
      collection_name: "games-collection",
      points: points
    });

    totalMigrated += rows.length;
    offset += batchSize;
    console.log(`Migrated ${totalMigrated} game objects...`);
  }

  console.log(`Migration complete! Total game objects migrated: ${totalMigrated}`);
}

Verify Migration

async function verifyMigration() {
  // Count total points in Qdrant
  const totalPoints = await qdrantClient.points.count({
    collection_name: "games-collection"
  });

  // Verify a random sample
  const sampleQuery = {
    limit: 5,
    with_payload: true
  };

  const sampleResults = await qdrantClient.points.search({
    collection_name: "games-collection",
    query_vector: null,
    ...sampleQuery
  });

  console.log("Sample verification results:", 
    sampleResults.points.map(p => ({
      id: p.id,
      genres: p.payload.games_metadata.genres,
      name: p.payload.text_fields.name
    })));
}
Best Practices
Error Handling

try {
  await migrateFromSQLite();
  await verifyMigration();
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Migration failed:", error);
  // Implement retry logic or partial migration handling
}
Performance Optimization
Adjust batch size based on available memory
Monitor SQLite connection pool
Consider implementing progress tracking
Data Validation
Verify embedding dimensions match
Check metadata formats before migration
Validate data consistency after migration
Remember
Test the migration process with a small subset of data first to validate the flow and optimize performance characteristics for your specific dataset.

I know that there is SelfQueryRetriver can you show me an langchain example with qdrant?
PHIND-70B MODEL
Error
Failed to generate input event list. This should never happen.. We have alerts for this and are working on fixing it.

Here's how to implement a SelfQueryRetriever with Qdrant in LangChain:

Architecture Overview
Let's first understand how the SelfQueryRetriever works with Qdrant:






The diagram illustrates the key components of our SelfQueryRetriever implementation:

The LangChain Client initiates queries and receives results
The SelfQueryRetriever acts as a bridge between LangChain and Qdrant
Qdrant DB stores and retrieves documents with their vector embeddings
Each document in Qdrant contains both the vector embedding (for similarity search) and the original game data (metadata and text fields).

Implementation
Here's how to implement this architecture:


import { QdrantClient } from "@qdrant/qdrant-js";
import { SelfQueryRetriever } from "@langchain/retrievers/self";
import { QdrantVectorStore } from "@langchain/vectorstores/qdrant";

// Initialize Qdrant client
const qdrantClient = new QdrantClient({
  host: process.env.QDRANT_HOST || "localhost",
  port: parseInt(process.env.QDRANT_PORT || "6333"),
});

// Initialize vector store
const vectorStore = new QdrantVectorStore(
  qdrantClient,
  "games-collection",
  {
    persistKey: "text_fields",
    embeddingKey: "embedding",
  }
);

// Create retriever
const retriever = new SelfQueryRetriever({
  vectorStore,
  searchArgs: {
    limit: 5,
    filter: {
      must: [
        { match: { payload_games_metadata_genres: "Action" }}
      ]
    }
  }
});

// Example usage
async function queryGames(query: string) {
  const results = await retriever.fetch(query);
  return results.map(doc => ({
    id: doc.id,
    name: doc.payload.text_fields.name,
    description: doc.payload.text_fields.description,
    genres: doc.payload.games_metadata.genres,
    platforms: doc.payload.games_metadata.platforms
  }));
}
Advanced Configuration
You can customize the retriever with additional options:


const retriever = new SelfQueryRetriever({
  vectorStore,
  searchArgs: {
    limit: 5,
    filter: {
      must: [
        { match: { payload_games_metadata_genres: "Action" }}
      ]
    },
    with_payload: true,
    with_vectors: false
  },
  // Optional: customize scoring function
  scoreFn: (doc) => {
    const score = doc.score;
    // Add custom scoring based on metadata
    const genreBoost = doc.payload.games_metadata.genres.includes("Action") ? 1.2 : 1.0;
    return score * genreBoost;
  }
});
Best Practices
Performance Optimization
Adjust limit based on your use case
Use efficient filtering with filter parameter
Consider implementing caching for frequent queries
Error Handling

try {
  const results = await retriever.fetch(query);
  // Process results
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Retrieval failed:", error);
  // Implement fallback or retry logic
}
Custom Scoring
Implement custom scoring functions based on your needs
Consider metadata importance in scoring
Test different scoring strategies
Remember
Test your implementation with a small dataset first to validate the flow and optimize performance characteristics for your specific use case.
